As a political scientist, my research interests are centered around party and party system change, particularly the development of new political parties in established systems. However, I am broadly interested in applying machine learning techniques to modeling human behavior. Outside of social science, I am passionate about a variety of topics, one of which is sports analytics.

My skill set combines a formal education in statistics and quantitative methods and a passion for coding and computing. I am comfortable using a variety of machine learning tools, and my specialty lies in causal inference, NLP, and predictive modeling. However, I continue to be enthusiastic about developing my existing skills and expanding my knowledge of the field.
